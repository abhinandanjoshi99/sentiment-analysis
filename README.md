# sentiment-analysis

In this project, using the NLTK toolkit in python, the machine is trained with a vast dataset which already contains some text in natural language and their sentiment. The accuracy is evaluated using test data and the result that the machine has generated based on what it has learned so far using training data.

The Machine Learning Algorithms like Logistic Regression andSupport Vector Machine are used.
